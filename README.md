An Introduction to Programming in Go
====================================

A documented compilation of code examples and exercises that follow the book ["An Introduction of Programming in GO](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) by Caleb Doxsey.

I claim no reponsibility for the examples themselves, Caleb did a great job, I merely documented them and published them for others to find and use.

Enjoy!
